# Day 4 - Under Construction Page
---

Today's small hack is a under construction page I made for an upcoming client site. The company name was intentionally changed. Since I normally use **[animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)** I decided to mix things up and use **[jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)** for some effects today. Other than that Jade and Stylus were used for markup and styling respectively.
